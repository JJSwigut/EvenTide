# Description

  EvenTide is meant to provide boaters with a quick snapshot of relevant
  tidal data in a user-friendly way with as little effort and input from
  the user as possible. For users that would like to dig deeper into the
  forecasts and sensory data collected by tide-stations, the app aims to
  provide an expedient and obvious route to such information.
